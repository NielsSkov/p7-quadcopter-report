%The results obtained show both the attitude and simulated position response of the quadcopter.
The network delay and sampling rate affect the controllers' performance, however, they still achieve the given references in simulation. Experimental results could not be presented for the translational controllers, as it has not been possible to successfully implement the translational controllers in due time. The design is however deemed valid, as simulations show that the design should work in reality. The attitude controller is implemented and achieves the given references. 
%The network limits the design bandwidth, especially for the attitude controller, due to the limited frequency in which the sensor data is obtained from the motion tracking system. A faster response is achievable if on board sensors for acquiring the attitude are utilized.
%The results obtained in the simulations show both the attitude and position response of the quadcopter.

%It is seen that the controllers achieve the desired reference even though the network delay and the sampling rate affect the performance. The main network effect is the designed bandwidth of the controllers. This occurs due to the limited frequency in which the sensor data is obtained from the motion tracking system through the wireless connection. 
%It is also worth observing how the attitude controller shows a permanent error with respect to the reference. This is generated as a result of the integral controller design because it assumes a constant reference applied to it. This issue, though, does not affect the final position of the quadcopter.
