The control system has been split into an attitude and a translational controller. The former has been designed using a state space approach, including state feedback with integral control and a reduced order observer. The translational control system has been designed with a classical control approach and result in three cascade loops, including proportional and PI controllers.
The results obtained from the design show that both the attitude and the translational behavior of the quadcopter has been successfully controlled.
