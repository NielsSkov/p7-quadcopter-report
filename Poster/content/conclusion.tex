A linear control system has been designed, based upon a first principles model, to stabilize the quadcopter and control its position. The attitude controller has been designed in state space, while the translational controllers are based on classical control methods. Network effects are included in the control design to ensure stability. Simulations show that the translational controllers have been adequately designed. The attitude controller has been implemented and tested successfully.
%The attitude and the simulated translational behavior have been successfully controlled.
%In simulation the translational controller shows it is capable to obtain given references.
%The results show that the design for both the attitude and the translational behavior is able to control the quadcopter in simulation. Moreover, the implementation and test of the attitude controller have been carried out on the quadcopter successfully.
