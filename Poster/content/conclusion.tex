A model has been obtained by first principle modelling. A linear control system was designed to stabilize the quadcopter and control its position. The attitude controller has been designed as state space, and the translational control system is designed as classical control. Network effects are included in the control design. The results reveals that the attitude and the simulated translational quadcopter behavior have been successfully controlled.
