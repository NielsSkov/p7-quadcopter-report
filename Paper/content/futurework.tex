\section{Future Work}\label{sec:futurework}
The control system has been designed using an external motion tracking system as sensor for attitude and position. This system limits the operation area of the quadcopter. A future step could be to implement alternative sensors located on the quadcopter to further investigate the capabilities of the control structure and to enable outdoor flight.
 %able to fly outside the improve the result while keeping the same control structure, an inertial measurement unit could be installed on the quadcopter.
