\section{Future Work}\label{sec:futurework}
The control system has been designed using a motion tracking system as sensor for attitude and position. This system limits the operation area of the quadcopter. A future step is to implement alternative positioning sensors on the quadcopter, thus enabling outdoor flight.


 %able to fly outside the improve the result while keeping the same control structure, an inertial measurement unit could be installed on the quadcopter.
