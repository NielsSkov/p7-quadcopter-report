\section{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}

The results obtained show both the attitude and simulated position response of the quadcopter. 

It is seen that the controllers achieve the desired references even though the network delay and the sampling rate affects their performance. The network limits the design bandwidth, especially for the attitude controller, due to the limited frequency in which the sensor data is obtained from the motion tracking system. A faster response is achievable if on board sensors for acquiring the attitude are utilized.

Experimental results could not be presented for the translational controllers. As the attitude design has been validated with the same simulation and it works in reality, it can be suggested that it is not the design but the implementation of the translational controllers which prevents the realization of a flying quadcopter.

%The attitude controller tracks the given references in roll and pitch. The network delay 
%It is also worth observing how the attitude controller shows a permanent error with respect to the reference. This is generated as a result of the integral controller design because it assumes a constant reference applied to it. This issue, though, does not affect the final position of the quadcopter.
