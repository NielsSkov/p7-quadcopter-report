Quadcopters are becoming increasingly interesting due to the great variety of usage. A design that is able to make the quadcopter hover and move to a desired position is presented. The systemâ€™s coupled behavior and instability raises a challenging control task. This task is solved by implementing a linear controller design, which is based upon a model derived by first principle modeling. The control system is divided into attitude and translational. These are designed by using state space and classical control methods, respectively. The quadcopter gets its attitude and position from an external motion tracking system based on infrared cameras, keeping the control in a micro processor on the quadcopter. This layout constitutes a distributed system, where network issues, such as delays and missed packets, are taken into account.
