Quadcopters are becoming increasingly interesting due to the great variety of usage they offer. A design that is able to make the quadcopter hover and move to a desired position is presented. The systemâ€™s coupled behavior and instability raises a challenging control task. This task is solved by implementing a linear control design, which is based upon a model derived by first principles modeling. The control system is divided into attitude and translational. These are designed using state space and classical control methods, respectively. The quadcopter gets its attitude and position from an external motion tracking system based on infrared cameras, while the control remains in the microcontroller on the quadcopter. This layout constitutes a distributed system, where network issues occur. These are considered in the control design to ensure the stability.
