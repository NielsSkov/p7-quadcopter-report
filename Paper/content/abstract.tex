Quadcopters are becoming increasingly interesting due to the great variety of usage. In this paper the aim is to design a system, that will make the quadcopter hover and move to a desired position. The systemâ€™s coupled behavior and instability raises a challenging control task. We will solve this task by implementing a controller design, that is based upon a model that is derived by first principle physics. This is later linearized by the Taylor approximation. The controller is made up of multiple subsystems. An attitude controller and a translational controller are designed as state space control and classical control respectively. The prototype does not carry on board sensor, but gets its sensor input from Vicon and the control is done in the micro processor on the quadcopter. This is a distributed system, where delays must be considered in order to obtain optimal control.
