\section{Conclusion}
In this project, the coupled behaviour of a quadcopter was modelled by first principles of physics. A control system was designed in order to hover and obtain user defined positions.
The control system was split into an attitude and translational controller. The attitude controller was designed as state space with a reduced order observer with an integrator. The translational control system is designed as classical control and consists of three cascade loops of P- and PI- controllers. 
As the quadcopter is using Vicon sensor data a protocol have been designed and analysis of packets drops and delays have been done in order to ensure the control system of the distributed system remains stable.
