\section{Conclusion}
The behavior of a quadcopter has been modeled by first principles of physics. A control system has been designed in order to hover and move to a desired position.
The control system has been split into an attitude and a translational controller. The first one has been designed using a state space approach, including state feedback with integral control and a reduced order observer. The translational control system has been designed with a classical control approach and result in three cascade loops, including proportional and PI controllers. 
As the quadcopter uses an external motion tracking system to determine its position and orientation, an analysis of the issues that can arise when having a networked distributed system has been done in order to ensure the control system remains stable. The results obtained from the design show that both the attitude and the translational behavior of the quadcopter has been successfully controlled.
