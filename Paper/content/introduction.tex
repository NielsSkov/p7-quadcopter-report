%Present topic - uses of drones in reality context, chosen because it is a control challenge, rather than revolutionary.
In the last years, the interest for quadcopters has increased due to the multiple possibilities they offer. Among these, the most well-known ones are search and rescue missions in difficult environments, inspection of big structures and surveillance. \nolinebreak\cite{droneuses}

The quadcopter constitutes a control challenge due to its unstable nature and coupled behavior. It has six degrees of freedom, which are the three position coordinates and the three orientations. In addition, there are four actuation variables, namely the motor rotational speeds. \cite{draganflyer}

%Previous Approaches - examples of what others have done to obtain similar goals of stabilization like we pursue. What have others done differently than we plan to do to obtain the same end result.
The control of a quadcopter has been addressed multiple times in recent years. In Mian et al. \cite{backstepping} the quadcopter is controlled using a back-stepping technique and non-linear controllers. Another way of solving this control task is presented in Tayebi et al. \cite{quaternionsPD}, here the quadcopter's attitude is modeled using quaternions and controlled with a PD based controller. In \cite{MianWang}, Mian and Wang model the system using its dynamic equations and design non-linear controllers to achieve a steady flight, while in Mokhtari et al. \cite{GHinf}, the system is controlled by a mixture of a robust feedback linearization and a modified optimization control method.

%Describe our approach shortly.
%\fxnote{Why we do not include specific details of our hardware or our network in the methods??}
%\fxnote{Explain a bit what we want to do in the paper: See how these methods can stabilize a quadcopter ...}
%\fxnote{What you can consider to say is that you want to see if it is possible to use a linear control scheme with cascaded control to stabilize the attitude and position using networked distribution of sensors.}
This paper examines the achievable performance using a state space design strategy for the attitude control combined with a cascaded structure with classical linear translational controllers. Furthermore, the remote sensing and the attitude controller bandwidth effects on the translational controllers are considered.

%The approach presented here tries to control the attitude and translational position of the quadcopter using linear controllers and transmitting sensor data through a wireless network. 

In \autoref{sec:model}, the model of the quadcopter is obtained by a first principles method. This approach yields a non-linear model that describes the attitude and translational behavior of the quadcopter. The model is then linearized around an equilibrium point, which is the hovering position. 
%
Controllers for attitude and translational behaviors are designed in \autoref{sec:control}.% The attitude controller is obtained by means of a state space representation while the translational controller is designed using classical control. In the control system, the translational constitutes an outer loop and sets the reference for the attitude controller.
%
Since the sensors are not placed on the quadcopter and the information comes from an external motion tracking system \cite{vicon}, an analysis on how the network effects can be considered when designing the controllers is also given, this is described in \autoref{sec:network}.
%
In \autoref{sec:results}, the simulations and experimental results of the designed controllers are depicted and hereafter they are discussed in \autoref{sec:discussion}. Lastly, a conclusion is presented in \autoref{sec:conclusion} and possible future work is mentioned in \autoref{sec:futurework}.
