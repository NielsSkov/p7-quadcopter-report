\section{Results}
Simulation vs. reality. \\
%Design a setup that allows a nice measurement of reality - yet to be done\\
Comment on the results and how that correlates with reality, without discussing possible issues or improvements.
Model parameters: \fxnote{bring table with values}
Controllers:
Attitude controller:
Translational controller:

The inner loop proportional controller of the x and y translational cascade controllers are as follows:
\begin{align}
C_{\dot{x_I}}(s)= -0.19\\
C_{\dot{y_I}}(s)= 0.19
\end{align}

The outer loop  proportional controller of the x and y translational cascade are as follows:
\begin{align}
C_{\dot{x_O}}(s)&= 0.55\\
C_{\dot{y_O}}(s)&= 0.55
\end{align}
