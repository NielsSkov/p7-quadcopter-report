\section{Results}
Simulation vs. reality. \\
\\

%Design a setup that allows a nice measurement of reality - yet to be done\\
Comment on the results and how that correlates with reality, without discussing possible issues or improvements.\\
Model parameters: \fxnote{bring table with values}\\
Controllers:\\
The inner loop proportional controller of the x and y translational cascade controllers are $C_{\dot{x}}(s)= -0.19$
, $C_{\dot{y}}(s)= 0.19$ and the outer loops are $C_x(s)= 0.55$, $C_y(s)= 0.55$
The inner loop proportional controller of the z translational cascade controller is
$C_{\dot{z}}(s)=\frac{-201s+0.8}{s}$ and the outer loop is $C_z=TBD$ \fxnote{to do}.\\ \\
From this the following simulation and test are derived:
