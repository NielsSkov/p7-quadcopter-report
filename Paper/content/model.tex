As seen in the figure, the system is modeled by using two coordinate frames. The inertial frame is utilized to describe the translational movement, while the body frame is attached to the quadcopter and used to describe its attitude behavior. The positive references for rotational and translational movements are depicted in \autoref{droneDiagram}, as well as the main forces and torques acting on the quadcopter. The positive rotations follow the right-hand rule.

The forces generated in the propellers are obtained in the body coordinate frame. In order to represent them in the inertial, frame a rotation matrix is used. It is built considering a 123 rotation sequence \cite{rotationmatrix}. This means that any rotation is described as three rotations first around the $x_\mathrm{B}$ axis, then around the $y_\mathrm{B}$ axis and lastly around the $z_\mathrm{B}$ axis. 

The dynamic model of the quadcopter is given by three sets of equations, which are presented in this section. The first describes the motor and the propeller, the second and the third characterize the attitude and translational behavior of the quadcopter, respectively.

\subsection{Motor and Propeller}
The four motors on the quadcopter generate a rotation in the propellers, which creates the force that lifts the quadcopter. This thrust force is modeled proportional to the square of the motor rotational speed. The thrust coefficient for each motor is found experimentally.
 
The rotation also generates a torque on each motor due to the aerodynamic drag. It is also described as proportional to the square of the rotational speed in terms of a drag coefficient, which is also obtained experimentally. The total drag torque is compensated in the quadcopter by having two of the motors turning in one direction and the two others in the opposite direction.

The expressions for the thrust force and drag torque caused by the rotation of each propeller are
%
\begin{flalign}
	F&=k_{\mathrm{th}}\omega^2\ ,\label{eq:thrustForce}\\
	\tau&=k_{\mathrm{d}}\omega^2\ ,\label{eq:dragTorque}
\end{flalign}
%
\noindent where $F$ is the thrust force, $k_{\mathrm{th}}$ [\si{N s^2  rad^{-2}}] is the thrust coefficient, $\omega$ is the angular speed of the motor, $\tau$ is the drag torque and $k_{\mathrm{d}}$ [\si{N m s^2  rad^{-2}}] is the drag coefficient.
%\begin{where}
%  \va{F}{is the thrust force}{N}
%  \va{k_{th}}{is the thrust coefficient}{N\  s^2 \  rad^{-2}}
%  \va{\omega}{is the angular velocity}{rad s^-1}
%  \va{\tau}{is the drag torque}{N m}
%  \va{k_d}{is the drag coefficient}{N \  m\  s^2 \  rad^{-2}}
%\end{where}
%These equations are used in the attitude and translational models presented below.
%
\subsection{Attitude Model}
The attitude model equations, based on Newton's Second Law for rotational movement, state how the thrust forces and the drag torques in \eqref{eq:thrustForce} and \eqref{eq:dragTorque} influence the attitude behavior:
%
\begin{flalign}
	J_x\ddot{\phi}&=k_{\mathrm{th}} (\omega^2_4-\omega^2_2)  L\ , \label{eq:AngleEqVelocities1}\\
	J_y\ddot{\theta}&=k_{\mathrm{th}} (\omega^2_1-\omega^2_3)  L\ , \label{eq:AngleEqVelocities2} \\
	J_z\ddot{\psi}&=k_{\mathrm{d}} (\omega^2_1-\omega^2_2+\omega^2_3-\omega^2_4)\ ,\label{eq:AngleEqVelocities3}
\end{flalign}

\noindent where $J_x$, $J_y$ and $J_z$ are the moments of inertia around the three axes of rotation. $\ddot{\phi}$, $\ddot{\theta}$ and $\ddot{\psi}$ are the angular accelerations in roll, pitch and yaw. $\omega_i$ is the rotational speed of each motor. $L$ is the distance between the center of the quadcopter and the position of the motors. The parameters of the model are found in \autoref{sec:results}.
  
\subsection{Translational Model}
The equations describing the response of the system along the inertial x, y and z axes are derived from Newton's Second Law of Motion. The forces acting on the system are the thrust forces and the gravitational force. By using \eqref{eq:thrustForce} 
%
\begin{flalign}
     m\ddot{x}_{\mathrm{I}} = &-k_{\mathrm{th}} ({\omega_1}^2+{\omega_2}^2+{\omega_3}^2+{\omega_4}^2) \label{eq:AccelerationEqInertial1}\\
     & \ \times (\cos\phi \sin\theta \cos\psi + \sin\phi\sin\psi) \ ,   \nonumber\\
     m \ddot{y}_{\mathrm{I}} = &-k_{\mathrm{th}}({\omega_1}^2+{\omega_2}^2+{\omega_3}^2+{\omega_4}^2) \label{eq:AccelerationEqInertial2}\\
     & \ \times (\cos\phi \sin\theta \sin\psi - \sin\phi \cos\psi)\ ,  \nonumber\\
     m\ddot{z}_{\mathrm{I}} = &F_g-k_{\mathrm{th}}\ ({\omega_1}^2+{\omega_2}^2+{\omega_3}^2+{\omega_4}^2) \label{eq:AccelerationEqInertial3}\\
     & \ \times \cos\phi\cos\theta\ ,  \nonumber
\end{flalign}
\noindent where $m$ is the mass of the quadcopter, $\ddot{x}_{\mathrm{I}}$, $\ddot{y}_{\mathrm{I}}$ and $\ddot{z}_{\mathrm{I}}$ are the accelerations along the inertial reference frame directions, $\phi$, $\theta$ and $\psi$ are the roll, pitch and yaw angles and $F_g$ is the gravitational force acting on the quadcopter. The parameters of the model are found in \autoref{sec:results}.

%It is worth mentioning that, as the thrust forces always point along the ${z}_{\mathrm{B}}$ direction, the accelerations along ${x}_{\mathrm{I}}$ and ${y}_{\mathrm{I}}$ directions are zero when pitch and roll angles are zero. 
\subsection{Linearization}
The model equations are linearized using the first order Taylor approximation around an equilibrium point, which is the hovering position. This implies that the attitude and translational accelerations and velocities are zero. In addition, the attitude is set to zero.

Choosing a zero acceleration linearization point along the ${z}_{\mathrm{I}}$ axis yields an equilibrium rotational speed in each motor. These four rotational speeds generate a thrust force that counteracts the gravitational force. This is expressed as
\begin{flalign}
    \overline{\omega}_i=\sqrt{\frac{mg}{4k_{\mathrm{th}}}} \ .
    \label{eq:equilibriumomegas}
\end{flalign}
\indent The resulting equations for the attitude model after the linearization are 
\begin{flalign}
  J_x \Delta\ddot{\phi}  = &2 k_{\mathrm{th}} L {\overline{\omega}_4} \Delta \omega_4 - 2\ k_{\mathrm{th}} L {\overline{\omega}_2} \Delta \omega_2\ ,
  \label{eqAngleLin1} \\
  J_y\Delta\ddot{\theta} =&2 k_{\mathrm{th}} L \overline{\omega}_1 \Delta \omega_1 - 2 k_{\mathrm{th}} L \overline{\omega}_3 \Delta \omega_3\ ,
  \label{eqAngleLin2} \\
  J_z\Delta\ddot{\psi}= &2 k_{\mathrm{d}} {\overline{\omega}_1} \Delta \omega_1 - 2 k_{\mathrm{d}}{\overline{\omega}_2} \Delta \omega_2 \label{eqAngleLin3}
  \\ & +\ 2\ k_{\mathrm{d}} {\overline{\omega}_3} \Delta \omega_3 - 2\ k_{\mathrm{d}} {\overline{\omega}_4} \Delta \omega_4\ ,\nonumber  
\end{flalign}
\noindent where $\Delta\ddot{\phi}$, $\Delta\ddot{\theta}$ and $\Delta\ddot{\psi}$ are the changes in rotational acceleration from the linearization point, $\overline{\omega}_i$ is the rotational speed of each motor to achieve equilibrium along the $z_\mathrm{I}$ axis and $\Delta \omega_i$ is the change in rotational speed of each motor from the linearization point. 

Similarly, the equations of the translational model are linearized. The result is
\begin{flalign}
  m\Delta\ddot{x}_{\mathrm{I}} =&-k_{\mathrm{th}} ({\overline{\omega}_1}^2+{\overline{\omega}_2}^2+{\overline{\omega}_3}^2+{\overline{\omega}_4}^2) \Delta\theta\ , \label{eq:TransLinearEquations1} \\
  m\Delta\ddot{y}_{\mathrm{I}} = &\ \  \  k_{\mathrm{th}} ({\overline{\omega}_1}^2+{\overline{\omega}_2}^2+{\overline{\omega}_3}^2+{\overline{\omega}_4}^2) \Delta\phi\ , \label{eq:TransLinearEquations2}\\
  m\Delta\ddot{z}_{\mathrm{I}} = &-2 k_{\mathrm{th}}\overline{\omega}_1 \Delta\omega_1 -2 k_{\mathrm{th}} \overline{\omega}_2 \Delta\omega_2 \label{eq:TransLinearEquations3} \\
 &\ \   -2 k_{\mathrm{th}} \overline{\omega}_3 \Delta\omega_3-2 k_{\mathrm{th}} \overline{\omega}_4 \Delta\omega_4\ , \nonumber 
\end{flalign} 
\noindent where $\Delta\ddot{x_{\mathrm{I}}}$, $\Delta\ddot{y_{\mathrm{I}}}$ and $\Delta\ddot{z_{\mathrm{I}}}$ are the changes in linear acceleration from the linearization point in each direction of the inertial frame and $\Delta \phi$ and $\Delta \theta$ are the changes in roll and pitch from the linearization point.
