\chapter{Acceptance Test}
This chapter deals with the needed tests that the system with the state space must overcome in order to fulfill the requirements as well as an analysis of the other capabilities, described in \chapref{chap:specifications}.

\section{Requirements Test}

- \textbf{The Cubli should be able to balance starting from an unstable equilibrium position and null velocity.}

- \textbf{The prototype should be able to balance around \si{0\ \rad}, even though the angle of inclination of the baseplate is changed within a reasonable range, using internally mounted sensors.}


\section{Capabilities Analysis}
- \textbf{Maximum recovery angle}

- \textbf{Maximum catching angle with no initial velocity of the wheel}
