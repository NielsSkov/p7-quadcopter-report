\chapter{Implementation}
Throughout the design process, the delay in the network has been analyzed, a protocol has been created for the communication and controllers for the attitude, translational velocity and position have been designed. From this the scheduling, being a critical part of the implementation, can be considered. The scheduling handles the timing of receiving and decoding packets while also servicing the control algorithms. For this task a real time operating system is integrated as the base for implementation in the microcontroller.
\\
To implement the designed controllers, currently described in the continuous domain, they must be transformed to the discrete frequency domain.

In the following section the scheduling is described, followed by a section on implementation of the communication task, the discretization of continuous controllers and a final section describing the implementation of the controllers on the microcontroller.
