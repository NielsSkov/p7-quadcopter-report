Angle and Linear
Explain the two frames and include drawing showing them
Flow of the chapter

\Figref{diagramQuad} shows a representation of the quadcopter where two reference systems, inertial and body, can be seen, as well as the conventions for angles of rotation and forces. \Figref{diagramTorque} shows the body from above and includes the chosen convention for the torques produced by the propellers.
