\chapter{Model}
To make the \textbf{quadcopter airborne and have a steady flight mode it is necessary to derive a model of the system}, that describes its physical behavior. From this, a control system must be designed such that the desired flying characteristics are obtained. 
This chapter presents the model. 

First, a model overview is presented. Then, the model derivation and, lastly, the model is linearized as \textbf{this is necessary to be able to design a linear control system}. The model and the linearized model are compared in simulations. This ensures that the linear model is an acceptable approximation.

\section{Model overview}
The model can be split into two sub models. One being an angular model, \textbf{describing how the angles influence each other in pitch, roll and yaw.} The other sub model is a translational velocity model, that describes \textbf{the velocities} in the directions of the x, y and z axes. 
These models will later be combined.

When modeling the quadcopter, two coordinate systems are used. A body frame,\textbf{ that is a coordinate system}, that is fixed to the flying object and an inertial frame, that is a coordinate system that is fixed as the Vicon room. 

It is necessary to use both, as it is desired to know where the quadcopter is within the inertial frame to determine its position. To obtain the orientation of the quadcopter, the body frame's orientation compared to the inertial frame yields the angles of roll, pitch and yaw.

%\Figref{diagramQuad} shows a representation of the quadcopter where two reference systems, inertial and body, can be seen, as well as the conventions for angles of rotation and forces. \Figref{diagramTorque} shows the body from above and includes the chosen convention for the torques produced by the propellers.
