\section{Prototype Description}
In the following section an overall description of the prototype is given. This is done to help the reader understand the utilized setup in the project.
The prototype is divided into 3 separate subsystems. The quadcopter, the ground station and the vicon system. These subsystems can be seen in \figref{prototypediagram}.

\todo{explain somewhere what vicon is and that it can be found in aalborg university, maybe we should have a little section?.}

For this project the Vicon system is utilized to capture the position and orientation of the quadcopter. This is to avoid time consuming sensor set up on the quadcopter, as the Vicon system is already configured. The Vicon system is describe in further detail in section ??. The Vicon system transmits 

The quadcopter's most complex component is the microcontroller. It handles the control calculations, the PWM calculations according to the required control action and battery level, and the communication protocol necessary to exchange data with the ground station.

The microcontroller requires 4 PWM outputs with different and independent duty cycles for controlling the 4 motors in the quadcopter. 

The network interface in the microcontroller handles the incoming data from the ground station. This data consist of reference commands for the controllers and sensor data. It should also be able to send the battery voltage level to the ground station in order to detect when to end the flight.

The communication between the ground station and the quadcopter is done through wireless modules. These should allow the implementation of the communication by designing only the transport layer protocol.

The ground station gathers the information coming from the Vicon system and sends it to the quadcopter. This also includes doing calculations with the received Vicon data to obtain other variables like velocities or accelerations.

Finally, Vicon system uses the position of the markers placed in the quadcopter to provide its position and orientation. The orientation data is given in multiple forms but only Euler angles data is considered.


\textbf{Battery should be moved somewhere else}
The battery, which is available for the prototype, is a Zippy Flightmax battery. Its weights 141 gram, has an capacity of 1500 mAh, a voltage of 11.1 volts and a discharge current of 20 amperes.
