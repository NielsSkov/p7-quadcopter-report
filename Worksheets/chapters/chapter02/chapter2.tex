\chapter{System Description}\label{cha:Systemdescription}
In this project, a prototype of a quadcopter is provided with motors, motor controllers, propellers and a battery. The system in its initial state is seen in \autoref{fig:systemBase}. Apart from the quadcopter and the attached hardware, additional hardware must be selected to make the quadcopter able to fly. The provided prototype is firstly described in detail. Afterwards the selected hardware is presented. Lastly a prototype description is provided.   

% a tracking system called Vicon is also provided. This is used to track the quadcopter and provide it with sensor inputs.

%Additional to the provided hardware, an ATmega 2560 and XBEE modules are used as a processor and wireless communication modules, respectively.
