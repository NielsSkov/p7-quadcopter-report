\chapter{Acceptance test}

It must be tested if the designed radio complies with the requirements mentioned in \autoref{ch:technicalRequirements}, which this is done in in the following. %Before the test can be performed pass/fail criteria and procedures needs to be formulated. 

There are three assessment degrees on how well the developed prototype satisfies the requirements. The degrees are \ding{51} for a pass, (\ding{51}) for a partial pass and \ding{55} for a fail. 

\subsection*{Requirements Overview}
For repetition, the requirements that need to be met are:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{\arabic*})]
\item {The quadcopter should be able to receive its own position and attitude from the Vicon system each control loop, through a computer at the ground station.}
\item {The prototype should be able to disregard incorrect packets received from the computer.}
\item {The quadcopter should be able to land if the battery voltage is below 10 volts.}
\item {It shall be possible to control the quadcopters attitude.}
\item {It shall be possible to make the quadcopter hover and control its height while hovering.}
\item {It shall be possible to change the position of the quadcopter in the $x_{\mathrm{I}}$, $y_{\mathrm{I}}$ and $z_{\mathrm{I}}$ axis.}
\end{enumerate}

	\item[(\ding{51})]The receiver is able to detect transmitted packages at the beginning of the package, which has an SNR of max 2.8 dB, but false positives may occur.
	\item[ \ding{55} \phantom{)}]The receiver is not able to detect any transmitted packages.
