\chapter{Functionality Tests}
%It must be tested if the designed networked control system complies with the functional requirements mentioned in \autoref{ch:functionalRequirements}. 
The capabilities of the performed design have been tested in order to asses them in relation to the functional requirements stated in \autoref{ch:functionalRequirements}. 
%\subsection*{Functional Requirements Overview}
For the sake of repetition, these requirements are also stated below.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{\arabic*})]
\item {The quadcopter should be able to receive its own position and attitude from the Vicon system, through a computer at the ground station.}
\item {It shall be possible to control the quadcopter's attitude.}
\item {It shall be possible to make the quadcopter control its position in the z axis.}
\item {It shall be possible to control the quadcopter in the x and y axis.}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Utilize New Sensor Data in Each Control Loop}
%\textbf{Requirement:}
%\textit{The quadcopter should be able to receive its own position and attitude from the Vicon system each control loop, through a computer at the ground station.}

%\textbf{Pass/fail criteria:}
%	\begin{description}
%	\item[ \ding{51} ] One new decoded packet is utilized in each control loop.
%	\item[(\ding{51})] 99 percent of the control loops runs with the recent received data from a new decoded packet. Indicating that 1 percent of the time a control loop runs with old data.\fxnote{should we come up with numbers?}
%	\item[ \ding{55} \phantom{)}] More than 1 percent of the control loops runs with old data.
%	\end{description}

%\textbf{Procedure:}\\
The protocol designed and the scheduling have been tested following the procedure below.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Enable the computer, utilizing Matlab, to transmit 10000 packets to the microcontroller.
	%\item The data in the first transmitted packet consist of zeros, hereafter the data in each packet is incremented. The last packet will then contain the number 999. 
    %\item In every control loop the data which is utilized should be compared to the data utilized in the loop before. If the data is not identical a counter should be incremented.
    \item Implement the program in the microcontroller so two counters are enabled when the first of the 10000 packets arrive. One of the counters should count control loops and the other should count correct decoded packets.
	\item When the last packet arrives both counters should be stopped and their values should be transmitted back to the computer. 
	\item The comparison between the number of control loops executed and corrected decoded packets gives the estimate of the probability of missing packets.
%    \item The comparison should only take place if the communication task register a packet containing data which is less or equal to than 999.
%	\item The first packet consisting of zeros should not be compared to an old packets (as there is none) but is instead compared to the number 1001. 
%	\item The counter, which is incremented each time the data utilized in the control loop is not identical to the previous, should be transmitted back to the computer when the computer is done transmitting.
%	\item A counter incremented each control loop while packets are received should also be transmitted back.
\end{enumerate} 

\textbf{Results:}
The obtained results are presented in \autoref{tab:AccTestCom}
\begin{table}[]
    \centering
    \label{tab:AccTestCom}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
        \hline
       Controller loops executed  & Packets correctly decoded \\ \hline
       4468 &  4723\\ \hline
       4477 &  4651\\ \hline
       4354 &  4484\\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Results from the network test.}
\end{table}

It can be seen that, out of 10000 packets, less than half of them are correctly decoded in the microcontroller. This happens due to the control task having higher priority than the communication task. When a control loop is being executed, the microcontroller does not listen for new messages. However, missing these packets does not affect the performance as long a new packet arrives in the listening period.

The test reveals that more packages are correctly received and decoded than control loops are executed. This suggests that the vast majority of control loops run with the most recent information and that all packets received in the listening period are received and decoded correctly.

%\textbf{Procedure:}
The procedure followed to test the attitude controller in the quadcopter is the following.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Attach the attitude connector holder to the quadcopter, and the connector to the attitude quadcopter holder.
    \item Program the code for each of the test in the microcontroller (stabilize at equilibrium and track references).
	\item Start the transmission of attitude data from the Vicon system to the quadcopter.
	\item Switch on the battery for the quadcopter.
	\item Record the data given by the Vicon system during the test on the computer.
    \item Repeat for the rest of the tests.
\end{enumerate}
 
\textbf{Results:}

Three test have carried out to test the capabilities of the attitude controller. The first one shows how the controller can stabilize the attitude around equilibrium when starting with some initial conditions in the three angles. The second and the third one are done to test the reference tracking in roll and pitch, respectively.

The results of the first test can be seen in\autoref{fig:attitudeAccept}, where the attitude is stabilized.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\includegraphics[scale=.7]{figures/attitudeAccept.pdf}
	\centering			
	\captionof{figure}{Testing the quadcopters ability to stabilize around equilibrium.} 
	\label{fig:attitudeAccept}
\end{figure} 
%
The three angles start with an initial condition, \SI{-0.2}{rad} for roll, \SI{0.3}{rad} for pitch and \SI{-0.2}{rad} for yaw. After approximately five seconds, all the references are set to zero. It can be seen that the roll and pitch angles converge to zero in less than \SI{2}{s} and the yaw angle in approximately \SI{7}{s}. From the figure, it can be seen that oscillations of approximately \SI{0.04}{rad} occur around the stabilization point of 0 rad. These oscillations come from the deviations between the model and real system behavior, as the utilized parameters for the model could be different from those of the real system. These differences may originate in the test setup itself as it distorts the moments of inertia around the different axes and the location of the center of rotation with respect to the center of mass. %Furthermore, certain aspects of the behavior of the quadcopter have not been taken into account.

The response of the controller when tracking a reference in roll is seen in \autoref{fig:AccepttestRefTrackRoll}. The step is given at approximately 10 s.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\includegraphics[scale=.7]{figures/AccepttestRefTrackRoll.pdf}
	\centering			
	\captionof{figure}{Attitude controller response when tracking a pitch angle reference of \SI{0.4}{rad}.}
	\label{fig:AccepttestRefTrackRoll}
\end{figure}

It can be seen that the reference is tracked and there is no steady state error, there are oscillations of around \SI{0.04}{rad} also seen in the stabilization of the quadcopter seen in \autoref{fig:attitudeAccept}.



In \autoref{fig:AccepttestRefTrackPitch} a reference of \SI{0.4}{rad} in pitch is given to the attitude controller at approximately 10 s.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \includegraphics[scale=.7]{figures/AccepttestRefTrackPitch.pdf}

%            \centering

%    \hspace{0.03\linewidth}
%    \begin{minipage}{0.46\linewidth}
%        \begin{figure}[H]

%            \label{fig:AccepttestRefTrackRollPitchYaw}
%        \end{figure}
%    \end{minipage}
%\end{minipage}

From the figure, it can be seen that it is possible for the controller to track a change in reference. This is achievable while the roll and yaw angles remain at zero. The oscillations seen around the reference are approximately \SI{0.04}{rad}. This is consistent with the behavior seen in \autoref{fig:attitudeAccept}.

\section{Position Control in the z axis}
%\textbf{Requirement:}
%\textit{It shall be possible to make the quadcopter control its position in the z axis.}

%\textbf{Results:}
Experimental tests reveal a non functional $z_{\mathrm{I}}$ controller implementation. However, the design has been tested in simulation, including the network effects, as depicted in \autoref{sec:TranslationalController}. As the implementation of the attitude controller has been achieved in experimental tests, seen in \autoref{sec:accepttestAttitude}, it is reasonable that the design could be implemented on the quadcopter and work if more time was given.


% works as well, it is a matter of time to solve the implementation issues. 

\section{Position Control in the x and y axis}
%\textbf{Requirement:}
%\textit{It shall be possible to control the quadcopter in the x and y axis}
%
%\textbf{Results:}
Experimental tests reveal a non functional $x_{\mathrm{I}}$ and $y_{\mathrm{I}}$ controller implementation. However, it is believed that the designed is valid as it has been verified in simulations as depicted in \autoref{sec:TranslationalController}. As the implementation of the attitude controller functions in experimental tests, seen in \autoref{sec:accepttestAttitude}, it can be suggested that a simulated controller design could be implemented on the quadcopter and work if more time was given.
