\chapter{Introduction}
Drones has a wide variety of potential uses, such as search and rescue, inspection, security, surveillance, research, aerial photography, unmanned cargo systems, military applications, the list goes on. Drones are already widely used, and while some of the aforementioned applications raises ethical issues for debate, there is no doubt that drones also hold a place in the future.

Multicopters constitutes a class of drones with fixed-pitch propellers. This means that the actuation is achieved solely from a difference in speed between the propellers. Among all the different varieties of multicopters, see some examples on \autoref{fig:multicopters}, the quadcopter is the most popular, largely due to a compromise between stabilization capabilities and cost of hardware. \cite{TypesOfMulticopter}

The aim of the project is to investigate the capabilities of a specific design strategy when controlling a quadcopter as part of a distributed system.

The control of a quadcopter has been addressed many times in the recent years. One example is where the quadcopter is controlled using a back-stepping technique and non-linear controllers \cite{backstepping}. Another way of solving the control problem is where the quadcopter attitude is modeled using quaternions and controlled with a PD based non-linear controller \cite{quaternionsPD}.\\
There is a multitude of possible solutions, and while non-linear control is a popular choice for quadcopters, this project addresses the possibility of using linear controllers and Euler angle representation.

The quadcopter obtains its attitude and position over a network from an external motion tracking system. This introduces delay and packet loss as a limiting factor to the control system situated on the quadcopter. The controlling code is implemented in C on a microcontroller using a real time operating system (RTOS), called FreeRTOS.

The system's coupled behavior and instability raises a challenging control task. This task is solved by implementing a controller design, which is based on a model derived by first principle modeling. This is later linearized since it is desired to use linear controllers.\\
The system is divided into an attitude controller and translational controllers, where the translational controllers are cascaded around the attitude controller.

The attitude control strategy is based in state space design, and makes use of state feedback and an integral controller.\\
The translational controllers are designed as classical linear proportional and integral controllers around the inner state space design.

This project provides design and realization of the described system. It results in evaluation of performance tests revealing the capabilities of the system.\\
Subjects in focus are the performance achievable using the chosen linear attitude control strategy, the influence of remote sensing on the attitude control, the influence of the attitude control bandwidth on the translational controllers and the performance of a cascaded control structure with classical linear translational controllers.
