\chapter{Network} \label{ch:Network}
The quadcopter relies on a network between the ground station and the microcontroller, as mentioned in \autoref{sec:PrototypeDescription}. The information transmitted to the microcontroller is the attitude, position, translational velocity and the position reference.

To ensure that the microcontroller can detect packets and disregard incorrect packets received from the computer, a protocol is necessary. As mentioned in \autoref{sec:hardware} the lower level communication is handled by the XBees, and therefore only the transport layer is designed.

The effects of the network in the control system are analyzed using the MATLAB toolbox, TrueTime \cite{TrueTimeNew}. The issues considered are the delay from the sensor to the controller and the missed packets. Missed packets are considered to be when the controllers does not utilize the data from a new received packet in each loop.
