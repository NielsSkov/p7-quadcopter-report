\section{Package Loss Simulation}
The loss of packages in the system causes the controller to use old data in the loop. This effect is also included in the simulation by utilizing TrueTime. In the system, package loss is caused by the scheduling of the tasks in the microcontroller as information can not be processed when the controllers are running. Package loss across the wireless channel does not occur due to the low transmission frequency used. 

In the network simulation tool, package loss is simulated as a constant probability of loosing packages. To get this probability, tests are conducted in which \fxnote{PUT NUMBERS} packages. The amount of package received and processed in the microcontroller gives an estimate of the probability of lossing packages. The data obtained with the tests is shown in more detail in \fxnote{APPENDIX WITH THE TEST}. The used value for the package loss probability is \fxnote{VALUE OF PLP}.
