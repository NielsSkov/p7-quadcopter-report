\chapter{Controller Design}\label{chap:Control}
Attitude controller: Statespace 
Translational controller: X and Y two p controlles in cascade 
clasical controller, bodeplots, root locus. 


The system of the quadcopter has been described by a mathematical model, that is to be used in the design of a control system. The control system must stabilize the naturally unstable system of the quadcopter. It shall also ensure the desired behaviour, that is a stable flying mode, that can tolerate distubances \fxnote{we have not said that, purhaps, the text should just be removed.}

The model consists of two submodels, an attitude model and a translational model. It is therefore desirable to design two controlsystems, one for each model. These will however have to interact, as they share input and rely on each other. 

\autoref{fig:ControlHeadDiagram} is a block diagram of the overall control system.
