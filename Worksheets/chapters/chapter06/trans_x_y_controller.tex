In this section the governing model equations for the x and y axes is Laplace transformed and put on transfer function. 
\subsubsection*{Roll translational controller}
For the sake of repetition, the model expression for roll is as follows:
\begin{align}
m\Delta\ddot{x}_I = -k_{th}({\overline{\omega}_1}^2+{\overline{\omega}_2}^2+{\overline{\omega}_3}^2+{\overline{\omega}_4}^2)\cos(\overline{\theta})\Delta\theta
\label{eq:model_x_transl}
\end{align} 
Laplace transforming \autoref{eq:model_x_transl} yields:
\begin{align}
m x_1(s)s^2=-k_{th}\cdot (\omega_1 ^2 + \omega_2 ^2 + \omega_3 ^2 + \omega_4 ^2) \theta
\end{align}
It is desirable to have a transfer function where the input is the roll angle, as this is the output from the attitude controller that goes into the translational controller block. The output of the translational pitch controller must be the velocity in the x axes. \\
The transfer function can now be written as:
\begin{align}
H_{x1}(s)=\frac{x_1(s) s}{\theta}=\frac{k_{th} (\omega_1 ^2 + \omega_2 ^2 + \omega_3 ^2 + \omega_4 ^2)}{m s}\label{eq:conHx}
\end{align}
\begin{where}
\va{H_{x1}}{is the plant for the translational roll}{1}
\end{where}

From \autoref{eq:conHx} it is clearly seen that the plant is a first order system, that has one pole in zero and no zeroes. This means the system is marginally stable. It is also negative, which requires a negative controller gain to become positive. If this is not done, the controller gain will move the pole to the right half plane, making the system unstable. 

Moreover the zero-pole makes it a type 1 system, which means no steady state error will be present in its step response. 
A proportional controller is considered sufficient, as it does not have to compensate for a steady state error. By increasing the gain the system will become faster, which is desirable. To determine how large the gain can be without making the system unstable by saturation issues, it is necessary to consider the bandwidth. \newpar
The data from the Vicon is transmitted with 100 Hz. This means the attitude controller must run with 50 Hz as maximum to ensure the controller is slower than the sensor data. A rule of thumb states that the bandwidth of the system shall be 25 times smaller than the attitude controller. The desired bandwidth of the translational roll controller is calculated as follows:
\begin{align}
BW=2\cdot \pi\cdot \frac{f_s}{25}=2\cdot \pi \frac{50}{25}=12.57\label{eq:bw_X}
\end{align}
\begin{where}
\va{BW}{is the bandwidth of the plant}{rad \cdot s^{-1}}
\va{f_s}{is the sampling frequency of the plant}{Hz}
\end{where}

From \autoref{eq:bw_X} it is known, that the ideal bandwidth of the system is 12.57 rad/s.

\end{figure}
The bodeplot in \autoref{fig:bode_x} reveals that the magnitude is 2.15 dB at 12.6 rad/s and must be lifted by 

The frequency response of the plant with a  proportional controller with a negative gain of one can be seen in \autoref{fig:step_x}

\end{figure}
\subsubsection*{Pitch translational controller}
The model expression for pitch is previously derived to be:
\begin{align}
m\cdot\Delta\ddot{y}_I = k_{th}\cdot({\overline{\omega}_1}^2+{\overline{\omega}_2}^2+{\overline{\omega}_3}^2+{\overline{\omega}_4}^2)\cdot\cos(\overline{\phi})\cdot\cos(\overline{\theta})\cdot\Delta\phi
\label{eq:model_y_transl}
\end{align}
Laplace transforming \autoref{eq:model_y_transl_y} yields:
\begin{align}
m\cdot y_1(s)\cdot s^2= k_{th}\cdot (\omega_1 ^2 + \omega_2 ^2 + \omega_3 ^2 + \omega_4 ^2)\cdot \phi
\end{align}
The transfer function for the pitch is as follows:
\begin{align}
H_{y1}(s)=\frac{y_1(s)\cdot s}{\phi}=\frac{k_{th}\cdot (\omega_1 ^2 + \omega_2 ^2 + \omega_3 ^2 + \omega_4 ^2)}{m\cdot s}
\end{align}
\begin{where}
\va{H_{y1}}{is the plant for the translational pitch}{1}
\end{where}
 
Root locus and bode and all that and we end up with P controller

simulation of the controllers

Before designing the controller limit checks of the transfer function to verify if the model behaves as the plant is expected to in reality is carried out. \\
\fxfatal{I am having trouble thinking about it, as it is not entirely intuitive to me, when the input is an angle and not a force - however if possible, i think we should have a short piece of text to show we have been critical to the math we have derived - to check it before continuing.} 

Now that the limit checks confirms the sanity of the model, the controller can be designed. \fxnote{I still think that all of the above in this section shall be moved to the model chapter as conclusion of the chapter.}\\
