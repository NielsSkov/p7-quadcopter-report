\subsection{Controllers for x and y Axes}
The design of the controllers for the translational movement in $x_I$ and $y_I$ directions is done using the transfer function of the system in a Bode plot based design.

The linear equations for the translational model relate this movements with the roll and the pitch that the quadcopter has at each moment.
%
\begin{flalign}
    m\ \Delta\ddot{x}_I &= -k_{th}\ ({\overline{\omega}_1}^2+{\overline{\omega}_2}^2+{\overline{\omega}_3}^2+{\overline{\omega}_4}^2)\ \Delta\theta \label{eq:model_x_transl} \\
    m\ \Delta\ddot{y}_I &=  k_{th}\ ({\overline{\omega}_1}^2+{\overline{\omega}_2}^2+{\overline{\omega}_3}^2+{\overline{\omega}_4}^2)\ \cos(\overline{\phi})\ \cos(\overline{\theta})\ \Delta\phi \label{eq:model_y_transl} 
\end{flalign} 
Laplace transforming \autoref{eq:model_x_transl} and \ref{eq:model_y_transl} yields:
%
\begin{flalign}
    m\ \dot{x}_I(s)\ s&=-k_{th}\  (\omega_1 ^2 + \omega_2 ^2 + \omega_3 ^2 + \omega_4 ^2)\ \theta(s) \\
    m\ \dot{y}_I(s)\ s&= k_{th}\ (\omega_1 ^2 + \omega_2 ^2 + \omega_3 ^2 + \omega_4 ^2)\ \phi(s)
\end{flalign}
%
The inner velocity controller design requires a transfer function from each of the angles to each of the velocities, that can be written as:
%
\begin{flalign}
    G_{\dot{x}_I}(s)&=\frac{\dot{x}_I (s)}{\theta (s)}=\frac{-k_{th} (\omega_1 ^2 + \omega_2 ^2 + \omega_3 ^2 + \omega_4 ^2)}{m\ s} \label{eq:Gxdot} \\
    G_{\dot{y}_I}(s)&=\frac{\dot{y}_I (s)}{\phi (s)}=\frac{k_{th}(\omega_1 ^2 + \omega_2 ^2 + \omega_3 ^2 + \omega_4 ^2)}{m\ s}  \label{eq:Gydot}
\end{flalign}
%
\begin{where}
\va{G_{x_I}}{is the plant for the translational velocity in $x_I$ direction}{}
\va{G_{y_I}}{is the plant for the translational velocity in $y_I$ direction}{}
\end{where}
%
From \autoref{eq:Gxdot} and \ref{eq:Gydot} it can be noticed that the two plants are similar but with different sign. The controller design is carried out for the x translational velocity and applied to both afterwards.

The transfer functions are formed by an integrator and a gain. This means the systems are marginally stable in open-loop. $G_{x_I}$ has a negative gain, which means that it becomes unstable in closed-loop if a controller with positive gain is placed. This feature requires a negative controller gain to compensate that of the plant.

It is noticeable that, for this design, the variable changed by the controller is the pitch angle, which means that there is an inner loop (the attitude control loop) that is able to produce the required angle in the system. This is not accounted in the transfer functions. In order to be able to not consider the inner loop in the controller design, the closed loop bandwidth of the control loop should be 3 to 5 times lower.\fxnote{SOURCE 3 TO 5 TIMES} 

The bandwidth of the inner angular control is obtained by making a Bode plot approximation from the pitch angle reference to the real pitch angle in the quadcopter. The obtained Bode diagram is shown in \autoref{fig:bodePitch}. It can be seen that the frequency of the inner loop is 5 rad/s and this defines the bandwidth of the velocity control loop to be 1.67 rad/s.

%
%\begin{flalign}
%        G_{pitch}(s)=\frac{\theta (s)}{\theta_{ref} (s)}=\frac{\omega^2_n}{s^2+\xi \ \omega_n \ s+\omega^2_n}=\frac{86.05}{s^2+16.14 \ s+86.05}
%\end{flalign}
%
%With this new dynamics added to the system, the design of the controller can be done. The final rot locus of the plant can be seen in \autoref{fig:rLocusVelocity}.

%\end{figure} 
%
For the velocity control, proportional controller is considered sufficient as there is an integrator in the plant that accounts for possible steady state errors and output disturbances. Input disturbances are considered not to occur as those are related with the motors and the inner attitude controller handles them. In order to design the controller, the Bode diagram of the transfer function has been used. It is shown in \autoref{fig:bodeVelocity}.
%
\begin{figure}[H]

	\centering			
	\captionof{figure}{Velocity open loop transfer function bode diagram for the translational y direction.} 
	\label{fig:bodeVelocity}
\end{figure}
% 
The value for the proportional gain is chosen can be seen directly in \autoref{fig:bodeVelocity} as the distance between the 0 dB level and the gain curve at the desired frequency of 1.67 rad/s. The resulting value is -15.35 dB, which results in a gain of 0.17 with negative sign.

The final expression for the controllers for x and y translational velocity control is written as \autoref{eq:Cxdot} and \ref{eq:Cydot}, respectively. The plant for the y controller has already a positive gain and this makes it unnecessary to include a negative sign in the controller.
%
\begin{flalign}
C_{\dot{x}_I}(s)&= -0.17 \label{eq:Cxdot} \\
C_{\dot{y}_I}(s)&= 0.17 \label{eq:Cydot}
\end{flalign}
%
\begin{where}
    \va{C_{\dot{x}_I}}{is the controller for the translational velocity in $x_I$ direction}{}
    \va{C_{\dot{y}_I}}{is the controller for the translational velocity in $y_I$ direction}{}
\end{where}

The step responses and the corresponding control actions can be seen in \autoref{fig:stepVelocity} and \ref{fig:stepVelocityControlAction}.

%
Once the velocity controllers have been designed, the position controllers for $x_I$ and $y_I$ directions can be designed by using the same procedure. In this case, the position transfer function is just an integrator as seen in \autoref{eq:Gx} and \ref{eq:Gy}. 
%
\begin{flalign}
G_{x_I}(s)&=\frac{x_I (s)}{\dot{x}_I (s)}=\frac{1}{s}  \label{eq:Gx} \\
G_{y_I}(s)&=\frac{y_I (s)}{\dot{y}_I (s)}=\frac{1}{s}  \label{eq:Gy}
\end{flalign}
%
\begin{where}
    \va{G_{x_I}}{is the plant for the translational position in $x_I$ direction}{}
    \va{G_{y_I}}{is the plant for the translational position in $y_I$ direction}{}
\end{where}
Again, a proportional controller is sufficient to control the position of the quadcopter in the x direction as there is an integrator in the plant and the input disturbances are considered in the inner loops. 

The proportional gain is chosen so that the bandwidth of the position loop is 3 times lower than that of the velocity loop. This defines it to be 0.56 rad/s. To set this bandwidth, the Bode plot of the plant shown in \autoref{fig:bodePosition} is used. The distance between the gain curve and the 0 dB level at 0.56 rad/s sets the gain of the controller to be -5.19 dB or 0.55.

	\label{fig:bodePosition}
\end{figure}
%
The final expression for the translational position controllers can be written as \autoref{eq:Cx} and \ref{eq:Cy}. In this case, both x and y controllers are equal.
%
\begin{flalign}
    C_{x_I}(s)&= 0.55 \label{eq:Cx} \\
    C_{y_I}(s)&= 0.55 \label{eq:Cy}
\end{flalign}

    \va{C_{x_I}}{is the controller for the translational position in $x_I$ direction}{}
    \va{C_{y_I}}{is the controller for the translational position in $y_I$ direction}{}
\end{where}

The step responses and the corresponding control actions can be seen in \autoref{fig:stepPosition} and \ref{fig:stepPositionControlAction}.

%To determine how large the absolute gain can be without making the system unstable due to saturation issues, it is necessary to consider the bandwidth. \\ \\
%The data from the Vicon room is transmitted with 100 Hz. This means the attitude controller must run with 50 Hz as maximum to ensure the controller is slower than the sensor data. A rule of thumb states that the bandwidth of the system shall be 25 times smaller than the attitude controller. The desired bandwidth of the translational roll controller is calculated as follows:
%\begin{align}
%BW=2\  \pi\  \frac{f_s}{25}=2\  \pi \frac{50}{25}=12.57\label{eq:bw_X}
%\end{align}
%\begin{where}
%\va{BW}{is the bandwidth of the plant}{rad \cdot s^{-1}}
%\va{f_s}{is the sampling frequency of the plant}{Hz}
%\end{where}
%
%From \autoref{eq:bw_X} it is known, that the ideal bandwidth of the system is 12.57 rad/s. 
%\begin{figure}[H]

%	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/bode_x.png}
%	\caption{Bodeplot of the plant, with the bandwidth of 12.6 rad/s displayed.}\label{fig:bode_x}
%\end{figure}
%The bodeplot in \autoref{fig:bode_x} reveals that the magnitude is -2.15 dB at 12.6 rad/s and must be lowered by 0.85 dB. 

%The gain of the P-controller is found to be: 
%\begin{align}
%C_{x,y}=10^{\frac{-0.85}{20}}=0.907\\
%\end{align}

%The step response for the designed controller can be seen in \autoref{fig:step_x}

%	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/step_x.png}
%	\caption{Step response for P-controller with a gain of -0.907 and 0.907 for x and y respectively.}\label{fig:step_x}
%\end{figure}
%When examining \autoref{fig:step_x}it is seen that, as expected,there is no steady state error. The system settles at 0.41 seconds and has a rise time of 0.12 seconds. Both settling time and rise time is within the requirements \fxnote{we have not set the requirements - i just wrote it, it seems reasonable, but at some point we must set requirements, that are argued for in a previous chater that is to be written}. As it is a first order system, there is no overshoot and it can therefore be concluded that the P-controller meets all requirements.
%\\
%\\
%Before it can be implemented and tested on the quadcopter, it needs to be discretized. As it is P-controllers, it simply means to encounter the sampling rate. The discretized controllers are presented along with the continuous controller in \fxnote{make graph}.
%\\ \\
  
%\subsubsection*{Pitch translational controller}
%The roll and pitch translational models are very similar and will therefore be designed similarly. The design procedure will be the same as for the translational roll controller.\\

% 
%The desired bandwidth is 12,57 rad/s as derived in \autoref{eq:bw_X}.

%	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/bode_y.png}
%	\caption{Bode plot of the plant with the 12.6 bandwidth displayed.}\label{fig:bode_y}
%\end{figure}
%The bode plot in \autoref{fig:bode_z} reveals that the magnitude is -8.2 dB at a magnitude of 12.6 rad/s. The magnitude has to be lifted by 5,2 dB to obtain the desired bandwidth. 




%Before designing the controller limit checks of the transfer function to verify if the model behaves as the plant is expected to in reality is carried out. \\
%\fxfatal{I am having trouble thinking about it, as it is not entirely intuitive to me, when the input is an angle and not a force - however if possible, i think we should have a short piece of text to show we have been critical to the math we have derived - to check it before continuing.} 
%
%Now that the limit checks confirms the sanity of the model, the controller can be designed. \fxnote{I still think that all of the above in this section shall be moved to the model chapter as conclusion of the chapter.}\\
