\section{Translational Controller} \label{sec:TranslationalController}

General blockdiagram with the controllers and explanation (not in high depth)

\subsection{Controllers for x and y axes}
Derivation of the transfer function

Root locus and bode and all that and we end up with P controller

simulation of the controllers
\subsection{Controller for z axis}
Derivation of the transfer function 

Root locus and bode

Problem with P controller (Input disturbance)

Simulation of P controller

New controller
