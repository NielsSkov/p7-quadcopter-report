\section{Translational Controller} \label{sec:TranslationalController}

The translational controllers handle the movement of the quadcopter along the inertial frame directions, $\vec{x}_{\mathrm{I}}$, $\vec{y}_{\mathrm{I}}$ and $\vec{z}_{\mathrm{I}}$. The overall diagram in \autoref{fig:ControlHeadDiagram} is rearranged to illustrate the translational controller design structure in \autoref{fig:TranslationalControlDiagram}.

For each axis, the velocity and position controllers form a cascade control structure, where the position controller sets the reference for the velocity controller. In the figure, it is also possible to see how $\vec{x}_{\mathrm{I}}$ and $\vec{y}_{\mathrm{I}}$ controllers share similar properties as both have as output an angle reference for the attitude controller, $\theta_{ref}$ and $\phi_{ref}$, respectively. 
The $\vec{z}_{\mathrm{I}}$ velocity controller sets the required sum of motor rotational speeds, $\omega_{sum}$, such that the vertical position is attained.

In the following sections the design for the mentioned controllers is explained.
