\section{Controllers Implementation}

The implementation of the controllers can not be done having them as a continuous expression due to the discrete operation of the microcontroller. 

In order to discretize the controllers in the system, they need to be expressed in terms of the $z$ operator, the equivalent to the Laplace operator in the discrete domain. This transformation is done through the Tustin or bilinear approximation in which the $s$ term in the transfer function is substituted as seen in \autoref{tustin}.
\begin{flalign}
	s\approx\frac{2}{T}\frac{z-1}{z+1}
	\label{tustin}
\end{flalign}
