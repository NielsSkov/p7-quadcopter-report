%\textbf{\huge{Preface}}
This P1 project of the Control and Automation master program at Aalborg University has been carried out in the fall 2016 by the student group 16gr733. 
The focus of this project is to make a quadcopter stable and control its position in a distributed networked system. 
It is expected of the reader to have knowledge within mathematics and physics as well as electronics and linear control theory.
For referencing sources the standard ISO 690 is used, noting [n], where n represents a number in the bibliography. The bibliography is placed at the end of the worksheets, before appendices. Additional attachments are uploade along with the worksheets, these are code-files, MATLAB simulation scrips, online sources, and the paper and poster for this project.   

Anders la Cour-Harbo, associate professor at Aalborg University, has been the supervising the project. 

Aalborg University deserves a thank you for providing the quadcopter. A thank should also be given to Jesper D. Pedersen, industrial technician at Aalborg University, for building test setups for the quadcopter. 

Lastly Henrik Shøiler, associated professor at Aalborg University, must be acknowledge for his assistance in the labratory and kind sharing of implementational experiences.
